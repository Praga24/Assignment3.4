HDFS Federation :
In hadoop 1.x if the namenode fails , we cannot access the hadoop cluster which results in total failure.
HDFS Federation avoids this by maintaining multiple namenodes which takes care of different parts of the HDFS.
Eventhough one namenode fails the namespace volume managed by other name nodes are alive.

High Availability :
Multiple namenodes are in an active-standby mode.
If the active namnode fails the standby name nodes takes the place of it.
Both namenodes share the edit logs .




2.How HDFS handles failures while writing data?

Pipeline is closed.
Packets in the ack queue are added to the front of data queue.
Current block in good datanodes is given a new identity and it is informed to
the namenode.
The datanode that is failed is removed from the pipeline and a new pipeline is constructed from
the 2 good datanodes and remaining of the blockâ€™s data is written to the good datanodes in the pipeline.
The namenode arranges for further replica of the block to be created on another node.
If minimum replicas (1) are written, the write will succeed and the block is replicated 
across the cluster until the target replication factor 3 is reached.
